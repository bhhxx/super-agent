# Configuration

## Sources

| Source | Provides |
|---|---|
| `.env` (via `godotenv`) | Runtime switches such as `NO_TOOLS` and `YOLO` |
| `~/.superagent/settings.json` | Providers, permissions, sandbox, servers, agents, extensions, telemetry |
| Command-line flags | `--yolo`, `--no-tools`, `--approval-mode` |
| `~/.superagent/AGENTS.md` and project `AGENTS.md` | Layered instructions — see `session.md` |

If `settings.json` is missing, the app creates a template on startup. Invalid values — an unknown
permission mode, for instance — fail config load rather than falling back silently.

## Providers

```json
{
  "provider": "deepseek",
  "providers": {
    "deepseek": { "base_url": "https://api.deepseek.com", "api_key": "sk-...", "model": "deepseek-reasoner" },
    "openai":   { "api_key": "sk-...", "model": "gpt-4o" },
    "claude":   { "api_key": "sk-ant-...", "model": "claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219" }
  }
}
```

`provider` selects the default. Adapters live in `llm/`; the OpenAI-compatible providers send the
system prompt as a chat `system` message, Claude sends it through the Anthropic `system` field.

## Agents

The top-level `agent` selects `build`, `plan`, or a profile from `agents`. Custom profiles may override
`provider`, `model`, `prompt`, `tools`, and `permission_mode`:

```json
{
  "agent": "build",
  "agents": {
    "reviewer": {
      "prompt": "Review changes and report defects.",
      "permission_mode": "plan",
      "tools": ["read_file", "search", "git_diff", "lsp_diagnostics"]
    }
  }
}
```

Switching profiles clears the current transcript.

## Permissions

```json
{
  "permissions": {
    "mode": "ask",
    "network": "deny",
    "allow_tools": [],
    "deny_tools": [],
    "allow_command_prefixes": [],
    "deny_command_prefixes": [],
    "allow_paths": [],
    "deny_paths": [],
    "allow_env": [],
    "deny_env": []
  }
}
```

Modes are `ask`, `accept-edits`, `plan`, and `bypass`; `--yolo` maps to `bypass`.

**`YOLO=true` in `.env` enables bypass only when no explicit `--approval-mode` flag was passed.** The
flag always wins over the environment, so a checked-in `.env` cannot silently disable permission
prompts.

Command classification routes approvals and is not a security boundary; the sandbox described in
`tools.md` is what contains execution.

## Sandbox

```json
{
  "sandbox": {
    "mode": "strict",
    "cpu_seconds": 120,
    "memory_mb": 1024,
    "max_processes": 128,
    "max_open_files": 256
  }
}
```

`strict` is the default and fails closed when `bwrap` or `prlimit` is unavailable. Unsupported
platforms require an explicit `sandbox.mode: off`. Behaviour is described in `tools.md`.

## Servers

`mcp_servers` declares MCP stdio servers by name; `lsp_servers` declares language servers by extension.
Both are described in `tools.md`.

## Extensions

```json
{
  "extensions": {
    "commands": { "explain": "Explain $ARGUMENTS" },
    "hooks": { "after_turn": ["go test ./..."] },
    "skills": [".superagent/skills/reviewer"],
    "plugins": [".superagent/plugins/team"]
  }
}
```

Extensions provide prompt-backed slash commands, lifecycle hooks, `SKILL.md` instructions, and local
plugin manifests. Tool hooks must use recursion-safe direct execution so a hook cannot re-enter the
observer that invoked it. Hook events cover session start, before and after turns, pre and post tool
calls, approvals, and errors.

Commands, skills, and plugins are also discovered under user and project `.superagent/` directories.

## Telemetry

```json
{ "telemetry": { "log_path": "/absolute/or/workspace/relative.jsonl" } }
```

Defaults to `~/.superagent/telemetry.jsonl`. Records and their fields are described in `runtime.md`.

## Flags and Environment

`--cwd <directory>` explicitly selects the project directory. Relative values are resolved from the
process cwd. Without it, project resolution walks upward from the process cwd looking for `.git` and
falls back to that cwd. The resolved project root becomes the initial workspace primary root and cwd.

| Switch | Effect |
|---|---|
| `--cwd <directory>` | Select the project directory explicitly |
| `--yolo` | Auto-approve tools; maps to `bypass` |
| `--no-tools` | Disable tool calling |
| `--approval-mode <ask\|accept-edits\|plan\|bypass>` | Set the permission mode |
| `NO_TOOLS=true` | Disable tools from the environment |
| `YOLO=true` | Enable bypass when no explicit flag is passed |
