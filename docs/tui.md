# TUI

`tui` is the inbound adapter and the only interaction surface. It depends on its `Conversation` port
and its own display DTOs, never on `runtime` — see `architecture.md`. Runtime values become TUI values
at the composition boundary in `app/tui_adapter.go`.

## Feature Architecture

The TUI is feature-oriented and has one-way dependencies. A stateful user capability is a feature;
stateless formatting helpers and visual primitives are not.

Each feature owns its state, update logic, effects, and view. Feature state is private: one feature
must not read or mutate another feature's model. Features collaborate only through explicit typed
messages or intents. They must not import sibling features or share mutable state.

The root `App` owns only application lifecycle, global message routing, focus, terminal dimensions,
and layout composition. It may contain feature models, route messages to them, and compose their
rendered output. It must not contain feature-specific state, key semantics, or business branches.
Only genuinely cross-feature state belongs at the root; convenience is not a reason to promote state.

Input belongs to the feature that currently owns focus. The root handles only truly global input,
such as application exit or terminal resize, and otherwise forwards input to the focused feature.
Meanings such as submitting a prompt, choosing an approval, or navigating a menu belong to their
respective features.

Views are pure renderers. A view may read only its feature model; it must not call a port or service,
mutate state, start work, or emit business events. I/O and other side effects run as Bubble Tea
commands returned by the update/effect layer, and their typed result messages drive later updates.

Each feature defines the narrow ports required by its own use cases. TUI features must not depend on
runtime types, global services, or a shared interface that aggregates unrelated capabilities. The
composition boundary in `app` implements feature ports and converts runtime values to feature-owned
display DTOs. New capabilities extend the owning feature port instead of widening a common service
interface.

A TUI feature change should remain within that feature and its direct messages, ports, and adapters.
A change that requires knowledge of unrelated feature internals indicates a failed boundary and must
first be resolved by changing ownership or dependencies. Legitimate cross-feature flows may change
the participating features and their explicit contract, but must not create direct feature coupling.
The goal is controlled change propagation: changing one feature does not require synchronized edits
to unrelated features.

### Feature ownership

| Feature | Owns |
|---|---|
| `tui/composer` | The prompt input, its history, queued follow-ups, and the slash-command palette. Emits `Submit`, `Queue`, `Steer`, and `Clear` intents. |
| `tui/transcript` | Committed messages, the live window and what leaves it, live streaming content, tool-call and reasoning expansion, and copying the latest code block. |
| `tui/approval` | The pending tool-approval request, its selection, and the decision the runtime receives. |
| `tui/attachments` | Files queued for the next turn. |
| `tui/commands` | The slash-command catalogue, each command's input semantics, and the compact and MCP operations they start. |

The root `App` owns the turn lifecycle, the cross-feature error and status line, the help overlay,
the welcome block, terminal dimensions, and layout composition. A feature request that reaches
another feature — a prompt, an attachment, a snapshot refresh — travels as an explicit field of the
requesting feature's outcome, and the root performs the wiring.

`tui` may not import `runtime`, and a feature may not import a sibling feature or the root package.
Both rules are enforced by `tests/architecture/dependencies_test.go`.

## Commands

A command reports its whole effect at once: the error line, the status line, and any scrollback
output. A command that succeeds clears a previous error, and one that fails leaves the status line
untouched, because the error line takes precedence over it. Command output goes to terminal
scrollback rather than the live view, so long listings stay scrollable.

Session and configuration:

- `/instructions`: show the loaded instruction source paths.
- `/permissions`: show the current permission mode and tool approval status.
- `/permissions mode <ask|accept-edits|plan|bypass>`: change the session permission mode.
- `/sessions`, `/resume <id>`, `/rename <id> <title>`, `/delete-session <id>`, `/fork [title]`.

Agents:

- `/agent`: list built-in and configured agent profiles.
- `/agent <name>`: switch model, system instructions, and permission mode.
- `/plan`, `/build`, and `/mode <plan|build>`: shortcuts for the built-in profiles.
- Custom profiles live under `agents` in settings and may restrict tools.

MCP:

- `/mcp list`, `/mcp add <name> <command> [args...]`, `/mcp remove <name>`, `/mcp restart <name>`.

Context:

- `/memory`, `/remember <text>`, `/forget`: inspect, add, or clear cross-session memory.
- `/compact [summary]`: summarize and shrink the model context. See `session.md`.
- `/undo`: restore the latest non-empty checkpoint and truncate the transcript to match.
- `/attach <path>`, `/attachments`: queue a bounded workspace attachment for the next turn.

Workflows:

- `/review`, `/diff`, `/fix-ci`, `/branch`, `/commit-message`, `/diagnostics <path>`.
- `/export <markdown|json>` and `/share` write local files under `.super-agent/exports/`.

Extensions:

- `/commands`, `/skills`, `/plugins`: inspect discovered custom commands, `SKILL.md` instructions, and
  local plugin bundles.

## Keys

| Key | Behaviour |
|---|---|
| `Enter` | Submit when idle; cancel and restart with steering input while a turn runs |
| `Tab` | Queue a follow-up while a turn runs |
| `Ctrl+J`, `Shift+Enter`, `Alt+Enter` | Insert a newline in the composer |
| `/` | Open the command palette; arrows select, `Tab` or `Enter` completes |
| `Esc` | Clear input, or cancel a run |
| `Ctrl+U` | Clear input |
| `Ctrl+L` | Clear the visible main screen; terminal scrollback remains available |
| `Ctrl+C` | Cancel a run, or quit |
| Arrows | Navigate multiline input, or recall a single-line prompt without losing the draft |
| `Ctrl+Y` | Copy the latest assistant code block |
| `Ctrl+O` | Expand or collapse the latest tool-call group |
| `Alt+O` | Expand or collapse all tool-call groups |
| `Ctrl+T` | Expand or collapse the latest reasoning block |
| `Alt+T` | Expand or collapse all reasoning blocks |

## Mouse

The program does not capture the mouse. Selection, copying, wheel scrolling, and scrollback belong to
the terminal and use its normal bindings.

Composer rules worth knowing:

- The composer is multiline. `Enter` submits; the newline bindings above do not.
- Prompt-history navigation preserves and restores the current unsubmitted draft.
- Typing `/` opens the palette. The full palette shows descriptions and argument hints; compact mode
  shows names only.

Run rules:

- Queued prompts run in order. The footer previews the first three and summarises the remainder.
- Manual cancellation with `Esc` or `Ctrl+C` clears queued prompts. Steering cancellation preserves
  them, because the user is mid-thought rather than abandoning the work.

## Layout

The TUI uses the terminal's main screen, and the conversation lives in two places. The newest messages
stay in a live window inside `View`, alongside live streaming content, approval and command menus, the
composer, and the status line. Everything older is committed to terminal scrollback. Committed text is
the terminal's, not the program's: it is never repainted.

- A message leaves the live window when the window no longer fits the rows left above the composer.
  Leaving is a commit, not a discard: it is written to terminal scrollback in the same update and can
  be read back with the terminal's own scrolling. The rows the window gives up stay blank until newer
  messages fill them.
- Committed text is fixed. Tool calls are printed as compact action summaries, and expanding or
  collapsing rebuilds only what is still in the window, so inputs and affected paths stay directly
  below their owning tool-call summary for as long as that summary is live.
- The live window is clamped to the terminal width and height. The newest message stays in the window
  even when it is taller, so a long reply shows its tail until something displaces it.
- Reset, resume, compact, and undo rebuild the live window from current conversation state without
  re-printing anything, because scrollback only grows. The command prints a divider describing the new
  state, and the divider marks where the current conversation starts.
- The compact welcome block contains the product name, model, working directory, and final loaded
  instruction-source filename.
- User prompts are visually prominent. Assistant prose uses the available width without an extra
  left indent.
- Reasoning defaults to a compact `Thinking...` line.
- Below 18 terminal rows, queue details and command choices use their compact forms.
- The bottom status line contains permission mode, model, and whether tools are enabled.

## Approval UI

Tool approval is a selectable menu rather than a bare prompt:

- Arrows or `j`/`k` move the selection; `Enter` confirms.
- `1`/`y`, `2`/`a`, and `3`/`n` remain direct shortcuts for approve-once, always-approve, and deny.
- A submitted decision ignores repeated keys until the runtime advances, so a double keypress cannot
  answer the next prompt by accident.

The engine reports live states while actions run, so the header follows `WaitingApproval` and
`RunningTool` as they happen rather than only at snapshot boundaries.
